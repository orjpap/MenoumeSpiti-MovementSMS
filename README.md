# #MenoumeSpiti-MovementSMS
An easy way to send the Greek Movement Authorisation SMS that was (still is at the time of writing this, but I'm trying to be optimistic here)required during the COVID-19 lockdown described in https://forma.gov.gr/en/

Made with SwiftUI, never approved by the AppStore

Future humans feel free to use this in the next quarantine. Current humans I prohibit you from using this... I'm kidding, do whatever.
